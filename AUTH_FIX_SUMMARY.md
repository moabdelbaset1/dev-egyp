# Authentication & Session Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Console Error: "missing scopes (["account"])"
**Problem:** Middleware was using `node-appwrite` with API key to check authentication, causing "applications role missing scopes" error.

**Solution:** Changed middleware to use cookie-based session detection instead:
- Checks for Appwrite session cookies (`a_session_{projectId}`)
- No longer makes API calls with server client in middleware
- Added `/.well-known/` to public paths exclusion list

### 2. ✅ Login Not Working
**Problem:** `useAuth` hook was calling non-existent `/api/auth/account` endpoint.

**Solution:** Updated login flow to use Appwrite browser SDK directly:
- `login()` now calls `authService.login()` directly
- Sessions are created client-side using `account.createEmailPasswordSession()`
- Appwrite automatically manages session cookies

### 3. ✅ Registration Auto-Login Not Working
**Problem:** After registration, auto-login was calling non-existent `/api/auth/account` endpoint.

**Solution:** Updated register flow:
- After successful registration via `/api/auth/register`
- Now calls `authService.login()` directly to create session
- User is automatically logged in after registration

### 4. ✅ Session Not Persisting
**Problem:** localStorage checks were preventing session detection on page refresh.

**Solution:** 
- Removed localStorage gating from auth initialization
- Always attempt `account.get()` to detect authenticated users
- Appwrite SDK automatically handles session cookies

### 5. ✅ Console Errors for Guest Users
**Problem:** Appwrite SDK logs errors when checking auth status of guest users.

**Solution:** Created `suppressConsoleError` utility that:
- Temporarily disables `console.error` during guest auth checks
- Restores normal error logging after check completes
- Only suppresses expected authentication errors (401, missing scopes)

## Files Modified

1. **`src/middleware.ts`** - Cookie-based auth check
2. **`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`** - Fixed login/register flows  
3. **`src/lib/auth-service.ts`** - Silent guest user handling

## How Sessions Work Now

### Registration Flow
```
User submits form 
→ POST /api/auth/register (creates user account)
→ authService.login() (creates session)
→ Session cookie set by Appwrite
→ User logged in
```

### Login Flow
```
User submits form
→ authService.login() (browser SDK)
→ account.createEmailPasswordSession()
→ Session cookie set by Appwrite
→ User logged in
```

### Session Detection
```
Page loads
→ useAuth initialization
→ account.get() (checks session cookie)
→ If valid: user authenticated
→ If invalid: user is guest (no error)
```

### Middleware Protection
```
Request to protected route
→ Check for session cookie (a_session_{projectId})
→ If found: allow access
→ If not found: redirect to /account
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Register new account → Should auto-login
- [x] Login with credentials → Should create session
- [x] Refresh page → Should maintain login state
- [x] Visit as guest → No console errors
- [x] Logout → Should clear session
- [x] Visit protected route as guest → Redirect to login

## Technical Details

### Session Cookies
Appwrite sets HttpOnly cookies automatically:
- `a_session_{projectId}` - Main session cookie
- Managed by Appwrite SDK
- Secure and HttpOnly by default

### No localStorage Needed
- Previous approach relied on localStorage checks
- Now relies entirely on Appwrite session cookies
- More secure (HttpOnly cookies can't be accessed by JS)

### Error Suppression Strategy
- Only suppress expected auth errors (401, missing scopes)
- Unexpected errors still logged to console
- Prevents noise for guest users while maintaining debugging capability
