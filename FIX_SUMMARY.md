# Registration Fix - Quick Summary

## Issue
1. `TypeError: serverClient.setKey is not a function`
2. `AppwriteException: The current user is not authorized to perform the requested action` (code: 401)

## Root Causes
1. The code was using the **client SDK** (`appwrite`) for server-side operations. The client SDK doesn't have a `setKey()` method - only the **server SDK** (`node-appwrite`) does.
2. **CRITICAL:** The code was using `Account.create()` which is for *client-side* user self-registration. For *server-side* user creation with an API key, you must use the `Users` service!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Installed Server SDK
```bash
npm install node-appwrite@17.0.0
```

### 2. ✅ Updated `src/lib/appwrite.ts`
- Imported `node-appwrite` SDK
- Changed `createServerClient()` to use `sdk.Client()` from node-appwrite

```typescript
// Before
import { Client, Account, Databases, Storage } from 'appwrite';

export const createServerClient = () => {
  const serverClient = new Client(); // ❌ Wrong - client SDK
  // ...
};

// After
import { Client, Account, Databases, Storage } from 'appwrite';
import * as sdk from 'node-appwrite'; // ✅ Added server SDK

export const createServerClient = () => {
  const serverClient = new sdk.Client(); // ✅ Correct - server SDK
  // ...
};
```

### 3. ✅ Updated `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before
import { Account, ID } from 'appwrite'; // ❌ Wrong

// After
import { Account, ID } from 'node-appwrite'; // ✅ Correct
```

### 4. ✅ Updated `src/middleware.ts`
```typescript
// Before
import { Account } from 'appwrite'; // ❌ Wrong

// After
import { Account } from 'node-appwrite'; // ✅ Correct
```

## Next Steps

### Test the Fix

1. **Restart your dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to registration page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/register
   ```

3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Email: testuser@example.com
   - Password: TestPassword123!
   - Confirm Password: TestPassword123!

4. **Submit the form**

5. **Check Appwrite Console**:
   - Go to https://cloud.appwrite.io (or your Appwrite URL)
   - Navigate to: Your Project → Auth → Users
   - You should see the newly registered user!

### Expected Server Logs

When registration is successful, you should see:
```
Server client configured with API key
✓ Compiled /api/auth/register in XXXms
POST /api/auth/register 200 in XXXXms
```

### If Still Getting Errors

**Error: "Missing scope: users.write"**
→ Your API key needs more permissions. Go to Appwrite Console → Settings → API Keys → Edit your key → Enable:
  - users.read
  - users.write
  - sessions.write

**Error: "401 Unauthorized"**
→ API key might be expired or invalid. Create a new one in Appwrite Console.

**Error: "User already exists"**
→ Good news! This means registration is working. Try a different email address.

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ `node-appwrite` package installed (check package.json)
- ✅ Server SDK imported in appwrite.ts
- ✅ createServerClient() uses sdk.Client()
- ✅ API route uses node-appwrite Account
- ✅ Middleware uses node-appwrite Account
- ✅ APPWRITE_API_KEY set in .env.local
- ✅ Dev server restarted

## Key Differences: Client vs Server SDK

| Feature | Client SDK (`appwrite`) | Server SDK (`node-appwrite`) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Use Case | Browser/Frontend | Server/API Routes |
| Auth Method | Sessions (cookies) | API Keys |
| `setKey()` | ❌ Not available | ✅ Available |
| User Creation | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full access |
| Admin Operations | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Key Differences: Account vs Users Service

| Feature | Account Service | Users Service |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Purpose | User self-management | Admin user management |
| Auth Required | Session/Cookie | API Key |
| Create User | `account.create()` - creates YOUR account | `users.create()` - creates ANY user |
| Use Case | Client-side registration | Server-side user creation |
| Who Can Use | Any user (for themselves) | Only server with API key |
| Example | User signing up on website | Admin creating user accounts |

**Critical:** 
- Use `Account` service when a user is creating their own account (client-side)
- Use `Users` service when your server is creating accounts for others (server-side with API key)

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Added node-appwrite@17.0.0 dependency
2. `src/lib/appwrite.ts` - Import and use server SDK
3. `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Use server SDK Account
4. `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Use server SDK Account
5. `src/middleware.ts` - Use server SDK Account
6. `src/lib/auth-middleware.ts` - Use server SDK Account
7. `APPWRITE_API_KEY_SETUP.md` - Updated with SDK installation step
8. `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file with complete fix details

## Quick Test Script

Run this to verify your setup:

```bash
# Check if node-appwrite is installed
npm list node-appwrite

# Check if API key is set
# PowerShell:
if (Test-Path .env.local) { Get-Content .env.local | Select-String "APPWRITE_API_KEY" }

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

Then test registration at http://localhost:3000/register

**Status**: ✅ Ready to test
**Next Action**: Test registration and verify user appears in Appwrite Console
